# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## TASKS

### 0-bubble_sort.c
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below).
### 0-O
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

### 1-insertion_sort_list.c
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
- You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
### 1-O
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

### 2-selection_sort.c
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
### 2-O
Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

### 3-quick_sort.c
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
- You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
- The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
### 3-O
Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
